# Knyght MP Campaign
 MP Campaign for the Battle for Wesnoth TBS game. Has both Coop and PvP elements.
 Note: This is my attempt at creating something similar to World Conquest (the popular Coop MP campaign)

## Goals
 Make a fun Co-Op MP campaign of variable length.
 Actually make it into a MP campaign
 Add different scenario varieties other than just killing every enemy on map
 Utilisation of more Lua code than WML code or just a hybrid of both

## Scenario Variety List
 This is a list of all the possible scenario types presently available
 ### Will be Added
 1. 2 players v 2 AI
 2. 2 players v 1 AI
 3. 2 players v 3 AI
 4. Escort target
 5. Hunting enemy units
 6. Prevent target escape
 7. Survival
 8. Boss fight (boss picked from randomised selection, each with different playstyles and stuff)
 9. Monster hunting

## Key Aspects to Consider:
 1. Replayability
 2. Faction-Choice Liberation
 3. Randomisation

## Eras Used:
 1. Default Era
 2. Default+Dunefolk Era

## Upcoming Feature List
 1. Item/Artifact system of WC (if I can do it, that is)
 2. Customised Era waves (War of Legends/Era of Myths/Era of Magic/Ageless Era)
 3. Sub-Leader functionality (if main leader dies, a hero can replace her/him)
