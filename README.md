# Knyght MP Campaign
 MP Campaign for the Battle for Wesnoth TBS game. Has both Coop and PvP elements.
 Note: This is my attempt at creating something similar to World Conquest (the popular Coop MP campaign)

## Goals
 Make a fun Co-Op MP campaign of variable length.
 Actually make it into a MP campaign
 Add different scenario varieties other than just killing every enemy on map
 Utilisation of more Lua code than WML code or just a hybrid of both

## Scenario Variety List
 This is a list of all the possible scenario types presently available
 
 ### Currently Available
 1. 2 players v 2 AI (using default map generator)
 2. 2 players v 3 AI (using default map generator)
   
 ### Will be Added
 1. 2 players v 2 AI (using Lua map generator)
 2. 2 players v 3 AI (using Lua map generator)
 3. Escort target
 4. Hunting enemy units
 5. Prevent target escape
 6. Survival
 7. Boss fight (boss picked from randomised selection, each with different playstyles and stuff)
 8. Monster hunting

## Key Aspects to Consider:
 1. Replayability
 2. Faction-Choice Liberation
 3. Randomisation

## Eras Used:
 1. Default Era
 2. Default+Dunefolk Era

## Upcoming Feature List
 1. Item/Artifact system of WC (if I can do it, that is)
 2. Customised Era waves (War of Legends/Era of Myths/Era of Magic/Ageless Era)
 3. Sub-Leader functionality (if main leader dies, a hero can replace her/him)
