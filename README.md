# Knyght MP Campaign
 MP Campaign for the Battle for Wesnoth TBS game. Has both Coop and PvP elements.
 Note: This is my attempt at creating something similar to World Conquest (the popular Coop MP campaign)

## Goals
 Make a fun Co-Op MP campaign of variable length.
 Actually make it into a MP campaign
 Add different scenario varieties other than just killing every enemy on map
 Utilisation of more Lua code than WML code or just a hybrid of both
